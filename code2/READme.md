Anurag Kalra (kalra.25@osu.edu)

all code is in the code2 folder and reports are in the report2 fodler in pdf and docx format

##Instructions

We are using the feature vector made in the first assignment which is in the file 'feature_matrix.pytext'

Naive Bayesian
For naive we are using three approaches:
1) GaussianNB
2) BernoulliNB
3) MultinomialNB


To run naive - GaussianNB enter:

	make naiveG

Similarly for BernoulliNB enter:
	make naiveB

And for MultinomialNB enter:
	make naiveM

For KNN we userd the 80-20 and 60-40 split

To run KNN please enter:
	make knn


Contributions:
Shashank Agarwl implemented the "naive bayesian" classification
Anurag Kalra implemented the "KNN" classification


P.S. for KNN we had to import the backport of "Colletions.Counter" Class which is in the wull folder
